    "We were not able to fit a good model. Both SVR and linear regression had negative r2 values which meant that they were worse at predicting than just guessing with a horizontal line. Our ANN model was positive but had an r2 value of 0.0122 which is extremely low and not useful for any analysis. In order to improve our models we would do the following:\n",
    "* more parameter optimization\n",
    "* try other models (xgboost)\n",
    "* collect more data"
